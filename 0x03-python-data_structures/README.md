# 0x03-python-data_structures

This repository contains the code for the Python Data Structures project in the ALX School Software Engineering program.

## Description

The 0x03-python-data_structures project focuses on implementing and working with various data structures in Python. It covers fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, as well as more advanced data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

The project includes exercises and tasks that involve manipulating data structures, implementing algorithms, and solving problems using the appropriate data structure. It aims to demonstrate proficiency in working with different data structures and selecting the most suitable one for a given scenario.

## Installation

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x03-python-data_structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd 0x03-python-data_structures
   ```

3. You're now ready to use the project files and work with the data structures.

## Usage

The project includes multiple Python scripts and modules, each focusing on a different data structure or algorithm. You can run and test the scripts individually to observe the functionality of each data structure implementation.

To run a script, use the following command:
```shell
python script_name.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
