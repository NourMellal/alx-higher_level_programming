# Project Title: 0x02-python-import_modules

## Project Description:
This project is focused on exploring the concept of importing modules in Python. It provides various exercises and examples to help users understand how to import modules, use module functions, and work with namespaces.

## Project Structure:
The project consists of several files and directories:

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.
- **0-add.py**: A Python script that imports a function from the "add_0" module and demonstrates its usage.
- **1-calculation.py**: A Python script that imports functions from the "calculator_1" module and demonstrates their usage.
- **2-args.py**: A Python script that imports a function from the "sys" module and demonstrates command-line argument handling.
- **3-infinite_add.py**: A Python script that imports a function from the "sys" module and demonstrates adding numbers from the command line.
- **4-hidden_discovery.py**: A Python script that imports names from a module and lists all names defined by the module, including those that are hidden.
- **5-variable_load.py**: A Python script that imports a variable from a module and prints its value.
- **100-my_calculator.py**: A Python script that imports functions from a calculator module and performs mathematical calculations based on user input.
- **101-easy_print.py**: A Python script that imports a hidden function from a module and prints a predefined string.
- **102-magic_calculation.py**: A Python function that replicates the functionality of a given bytecode using disassembled Python code.

## Usage:
Each Python script in the project can be executed independently to demonstrate the usage of module imports and related concepts. Run a script using the Python interpreter, for example: `python3 0-add.py`
