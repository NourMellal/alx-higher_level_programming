# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions

This repository contains the solutions for the "0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions" project as part of the ALX School curriculum. The project focuses on understanding and implementing concepts related to if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python.

## Files

The repository consists of the following files:

1. `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Python script that generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
2. `1-last_digit.py`: Python script that generates a random number and determines its last digit.
3. `2-print_alphabet.py`: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop.
4. `3-print_alphabt.py`: Python script that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using a loop.
5. `4-print_hexa.py`: Python script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.
6. `5-print_comb2.py`: Python script that prints all possible combinations of two digits, ranging from 0 to 99.
7. `6-print_comb3.py`: Python script that prints all possible combinations of two different digits, ranging from 0 to 99.
8. `7-islower.py`: Function that checks whether a given character is lowercase.
9. `8-uppercase.py`: Function that prints a string in uppercase.
10. `9-print_last_digit.py`: Function that prints and returns the last digit of a given number.
11. `10-add.py`: Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
12. `11-pow.py`: Function that computes the power of a number.
13. `12-fizzbuzz.py`: Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."
14. `100-print_tebahpla.py`: Python script that prints the alphabet in reverse and alternating lowercase/uppercase.
15. `101-remove_char_at.py`: Function that creates a new string by removing the character at a given position from a given string.
16. `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function that replicates the given bytecode.

Feel free to explore the files to understand the implementation of each concept.

## How to Run

To execute any of the Python scripts or make use of the provided functions, you can run them using the Python interpreter. For example:

```
$ python3 0-positive_or_negative.py
```

Remember to replace the script name with the desired file you wish to run.
